# FizzBuzz in Python

## ðŸ“– What is FizzBuzz?
FizzBuzz is a simple programming challenge:  

> Print numbers from 1 to 100, but replace multiples of 3 with **"Fizz"**, multiples of 5 with **"Buzz"**, and multiples of both with **"FizzBuzz"**.

It looks basic, but itâ€™s one of the most famous beginner exercises and a common coding interview question.

## ðŸ’¡ Why FizzBuzz?
- **Logic Building** â†’ Teaches loops, conditionals, and modular arithmetic.  
- **Problem Decomposition** â†’ Forces step-by-step thinking: first handle `Fizz`, then `Buzz`, then combine them.  
- **Interview Filter** â†’ Many companies use it to test if you can code basic logic under pressure.  
- **Python Practice** â†’ Great starting point for syntax, readability, and testing.
